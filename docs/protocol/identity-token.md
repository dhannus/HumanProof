# HHTTPS Identity Token Specification

**Status**: Draft v0.4.1 — Implemented in production
**Last updated**: May 2026

This document specifies the format of HHTTPS identity tokens.

---

## Overview

An HHTTPS identity token is a JSON Web Token (JWT) issued by a HHTTPS-compliant identity issuer (e.g. hhttps.org). It asserts that:

1. A real human registered an identity at the issuer
2. The human has a verified role
3. The trust score reflects how strongly the role was verified

Tokens are short-lived (typically 1 hour), refreshable, and signed with ECDSA (ES256).

---

## Token format

A HHTTPS identity token is a JWT with three parts:

```
<header>.<payload>.<signature>
```

### Header

```json
{
  "alg": "ES256",
  "typ": "JWT",
  "kid": "<key-id>"
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `alg` | yes | Must be `ES256`. Other algorithms are not currently supported. |
| `typ` | yes | Must be `JWT`. |
| `kid` | yes | Key ID. Used by clients to fetch the right public key from the JWKS endpoint. |

### Payload (claims)

```json
{
  "iss": "https://hhttps.org",
  "sub": "human-verified",
  "uid": "0e3f4a8b-7c2d-4a91-...",
  "human": true,
  "actorType": "human",
  "role": "developer",
  "trustScore": 72,
  "roleLevel": "github-org",
  "ia": 1715000000,
  "exp": 1715003600,
  "jti": "5f8d2e91-..."
}
```

| Claim | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `iss` | string | yes | Issuer URL (e.g. `https://hhttps.org`). Must match a registered HHTTPS issuer. |
| `sub` | string | yes | Subject. For human tokens: literal string `"human-verified"`. For machine tokens: `"machine"`. |
| `uid` | string | yes | Opaque user ID. Stable per user within this issuer. Not personally identifiable. |
| `human` | boolean | yes | `true` for human-issued tokens. |
| `actorType` | string | yes | `"human"` or `"machine"`. |
| `role` | string | yes | One of the 15 defined roles. See [`roles.md`](roles.md). |
| `trustScore` | number | yes | Integer 0–100. Computed from verification methods used. |
| `roleLevel` | string | yes | The verification method that established the role (e.g. `passkey`, `orcid`, `github-org`, `bundestag-id`). |
| `ia` | number | yes | Issued at (Unix timestamp). |
| `exp` | number | yes | Expires at (Unix timestamp). Typically 1 hour after `ia`. |
| `jti` | string | yes | Unique token ID. Used for revocation. |

### Signature

Computed over `base64url(header) + '.' + base64url(payload)` using the issuer's ECDSA P-256 private key.

## Verification

To verify a HHTTPS identity token:

1. **Parse** the token (split on `.`, base64url-decode header and payload).
2. **Fetch the issuer's JWKS** from `{iss}/.well-known/jwks.json`.
3. **Select the public key** matching the token's `kid`.
4. **Verify the signature** using ES256.
5. **Check `exp`** — token must not be expired.
6. **Check `iss`** — must match an issuer your platform trusts.
7. **(Optional) Check revocation** by calling `{iss}/hhttps/check` with the token.

---

## Refresh tokens

To get a new access token without re-authentication, exchange a refresh token at:

```
POST {iss}/hhttps/refresh
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "refreshToken": "<refresh-token-string>"
}
```

Refresh tokens are opaque (not JWTs), single-use, and valid for 7 days by default. They are bound to:

- The user's credential ID (passkey)
- The user's role at issue time

On successful refresh, both a new access token AND a new refresh token are returned. The old refresh token is invalidated.

---

## Revocation

Tokens can be revoked at the issuer:

```
POST {iss}/hhttps/revoke
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "token": "<access-or-refresh-token>"
}
```

Revoked tokens are added to a revocation list. Clients SHOULD check the revocation status of high-value tokens by calling:

```
POST {iss}/hhttps/check
Content-Type: application/json
HHTTPS-Token: <token>
```

---

## HTTP headers

For convenience, HHTTPS defines a set of response headers that platforms can include to advertise their HHTTPS status:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `HHTTPS-Status` | `verified` / `failed` / `none` |
| `HHTTPS-Human` | `true` / `false` |
| `HHTTPS-Role` | The role from the token |
| `HHTTPS-Role-Label` | Human-readable role name |
| `HHTTPS-Role-Icon` | Emoji icon for the role |
| `HHTTPS-Trust-Score` | 0–100 |
| `HHTTPS-Method` | The verification method used |
| `HHTTPS-Issuer` | The issuer URL |
| `HHTTPS-Protocol-Version` | Current: `0.4.1` |

These headers are consumed by the browser extension to render visual indicators.

## Security considerations

- **Trust the issuer**: An identity token is only as trustworthy as its issuer. Platforms should maintain a list of trusted issuers and reject tokens from unknown sources.
- **Short TTLs**: Default 1-hour TTL limits the impact of token compromise.
- **PKCE for OAuth**: Public clients (mobile apps, SPAs) MUST use PKCE to prevent code interception attacks.
- **Pairwise subject IDs**: When tokens are issued via OAuth, the `sub` field is computed as `HMAC(uid + client_id, issuer-secret)` so platforms cannot correlate users across the federation.
